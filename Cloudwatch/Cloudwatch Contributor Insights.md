Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights is a diagnostic tool that provides a summarized view of your DynamoDB table’s traffic trends. It helps you identify the most frequently accessed partition keys, which can be useful in diagnosing throttling issues. By identifying the most accessed and throttled items, the data engineer can gain insights into the table’s access patterns and take appropriate actions to mitigate the throttling issues.
