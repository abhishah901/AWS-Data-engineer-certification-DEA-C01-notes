A trigger determines how a flow runs. The following are the supported flow trigger types:

`Run on demand` — Users manually run the flow as needed.

`Run on event` — Amazon AppFlow runs the flow in response to an event from an SaaS application.

`Run on schedule` — Amazon AppFlow runs the flow on a recurring schedule.
