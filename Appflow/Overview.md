Amazon AppFlow is a fully-managed integration service that enables you to securely exchange data between software as a service (SaaS) applications, such as Salesforce, and AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Redshift. 

For example, you can ingest contact records from Salesforce to Amazon Redshift or pull support tickets from Zendesk to an Amazon S3 bucket.
