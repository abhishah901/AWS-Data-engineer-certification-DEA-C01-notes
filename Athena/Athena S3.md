Amazon Athena is a user-friendly service that uses standard SQL queries to analyze data stored in Amazon S3. With Athena, you can analyze data in S3 without the need to load it into a separate database.

Partitioning data in Amazon S3 and utilizing Amazon Athena for querying can significantly reduce the amount of data scanned, lowering costs.

Partitioning enables Athena to scan only the relevant partitions of data for a query, rather than the entire dataset.
