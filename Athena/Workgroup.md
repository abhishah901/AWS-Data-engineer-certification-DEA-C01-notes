An Athena workgroup is a feature of Amazon Athena that allows for the grouping of queries. By default, each account has a primary workgroup, and the default permissions allow all authenticated users access to this workgroup. Each workgroup that you create shows saved queries and query history only for queries that ran in it. This separates your queries from other queries within an account and makes it more efficient for you to locate your own saved queries and queries in history.
