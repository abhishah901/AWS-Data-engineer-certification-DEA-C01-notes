AWS Glue Catalog resource policies allow you to manage access at a granular level. 

You can specify permissions at the database, table, and column level. 

This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to restrict access to specific databases or tables within AWS Glue, such as the scenario described in the question.

 itâ€™s important to note that the AWS Glue Data Catalog policies define the access to the metadata, and the S3 policies define the access to the content itself.
