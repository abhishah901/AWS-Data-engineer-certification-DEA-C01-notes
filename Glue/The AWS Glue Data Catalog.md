The AWS Glue Data Catalog serves as a centralized metadata repository, containing references to data employed as both origins and destinations for extract, transform, and load (ETL) tasks within AWS Glue.

This catalog facilitates more efficient management of data sources, further enhanced by its compatibility with Amazon EMR, Amazon Athena, and other AWS services. 

A database in the AWS Glue Data Catalog is a container that holds tables. You use databases to organize your tables into separate categories. Databases are created when you run a crawler or add a table manually. The database list in the AWS Glue console displays descriptions for all your databases.
