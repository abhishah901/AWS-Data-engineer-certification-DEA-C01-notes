AWS Glue crawlers automatically detect schemas for data sources. 

Glue crawlers scan data sources, detect schemas, and store the associated metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. This enables Glue to handle changing schemas without requiring code changes. The crawlers run periodically to detect new or changed data.

Glue Crawlers automatically detect and adapt to schema changes, ensuring that the ETL process remains robust against evolving data structures.
