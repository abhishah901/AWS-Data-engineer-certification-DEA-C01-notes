AWS Glue Flex is designed for non-urgent data integration workloads that do not require fast job startup times or consistent runtimes. 

It runs on spare compute capacity instead of dedicated hardware, which can lead to variable start and runtimes but is more cost-effective.

With AWS Glue Flex, jobs run on spare compute capacity in AWS instead of dedicated hardware. 

This means that the start and runtimes of jobs using Flex can vary because spare compute resources arenâ€™t always readily available and can be reclaimed during the run of a job. However, this approach is more cost-effective for non-urgent workloads.
