AWS Glue offers a Job run monitoring feature that gives a quick overview of job runs, including status, timestamps, and other key details. 

For deeper insights, the AWS Glue Job Profiler goes a step further, offering detailed metrics such as execution time, data processing rates, and memory usage. 

These metrics are crucial for pinpointing performance bottlenecks and fine-tuning resource utilization in ETL jobs.
