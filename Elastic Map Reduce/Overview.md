Amazon EMR is a managed service that allows you to process big data workloads using popular frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, HBase, and others. 

By migrating your on-premises Apache Hadoop cluster to Amazon EMR and storing your data centrally on Amazon S3, you can take advantage of AWS servicesâ€™ scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness.

Utilizing Amazon EMR allows you to execute existing job scripts with minimal modifications while leveraging the managed scaling and cluster management features. 

Additionally, Amazon EMR supports transient clusters that can be created on demand for specific jobs and terminated once the job is completed. 

This feature can offer significant cost savings over persistent clusters that run continuously.
