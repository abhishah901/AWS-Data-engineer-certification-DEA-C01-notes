Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that enables you to easily connect applications together using data from your applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. 

It allows you to route real-time data streams to different endpoints and trigger workflows in a decoupled fashion. When integrated with AWS Step Functions, it can trigger complex workflows on a schedule, such as daily data processing jobs.
