Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects sources to targets. 

Pipes are intended for point-to-point integrations between supported sources and targets, with support for advanced transformations and enrichment. 

It reduces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing event-driven architectures, fostering consistency across your companyâ€™s applications. 

To set up a pipe, you choose the source, add optional filtering, define optional enrichment, and choose the target for the event data.
