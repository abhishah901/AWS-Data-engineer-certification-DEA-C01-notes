Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is an easy-to-use and scalable file storage solution for AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. 

It can scale up to petabytes of data without affecting your applications and automatically adjusts its size as files are added or removed. This makes it a highly reliable and available storage option for a wide range of workloads and applications, including AWS Lambda functions.
