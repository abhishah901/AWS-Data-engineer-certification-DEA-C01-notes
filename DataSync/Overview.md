AWS DataSync is specifically designed to accelerate the transfer of vast volumes of data from on-premises storage systems to AWS storage services such as Amazon S3. 

It supports fast, secure, and reliable data migration, making it an ideal choice for projects that require the distribution of data across multiple S3 buckets in near real-time. 

DataSync automates the replication process, optimizes the data transfer over the network, and seamlessly integrates with Amazon S3, allowing for the direct specification of multiple target buckets.
