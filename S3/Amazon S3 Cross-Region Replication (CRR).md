Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is a feature that automatically replicates data between buckets across different AWS Regions. This helps to reduce latency by allowing users to access a copy of the data that is closer to them. It also addresses the requirement of data sovereignty, as data is stored within the specific regions where the company operates.
