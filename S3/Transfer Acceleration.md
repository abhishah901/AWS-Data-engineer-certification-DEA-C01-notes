Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and your Amazon S3 bucket. 

It takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. 

As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path. 

This results in faster data transfers and reduced latency, which is crucial for the scenario’s requirement of fast access retrieval times.
