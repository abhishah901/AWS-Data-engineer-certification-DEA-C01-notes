The Amazon OpenSearch Service is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale OpenSearch implementations. 

It provides enhanced security, availability, integration with other AWS services, and lower costs compared to managing your own OpenSearch cluster. Furthermore, it enables the visualization of log data through Kibana dashboards.
