AWS CloudTrail Lake simplifies activity log analysis by integrating collection, storage, optimization, and query in the same product. 

By consolidating these features into one environment, CloudTrail Lake eliminates the need for separate data processing pipelines that span across teams and products.


AWS CloudTrail Lake provides an SQL-based query interface, allowing you to easily analyze your logs using standard SQL queries. 

This is particularly useful for auditing, security investigation, and operational troubleshooting purposes. 

CloudTrail Lake also features sample queries to help you get started with writing queries for common scenarios, such as collecting a userâ€™s activity, that can accelerate security investigations. With immutable event data storage and a default retention period of seven years, CloudTrail Lake can meet the compliance requirements of most users. 

CloudTrail Lake can also collect events from multiple AWS regions and accounts.
