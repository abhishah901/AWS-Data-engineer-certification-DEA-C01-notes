AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Redshift integration offers detailed records of Redshift API calls, including API caller identity, time, source IP address, request parameters, and response elements. This integration provides a comprehensive audit trail that includes the actions taken within the Redshift cluster and API interactions that affect the clusterâ€™s configuration or data query. 


The built-in audit logging and CloudTrail integration create a robust monitoring solution that secures and audits a Redshift environment, ensuring compliance obligations are met, and data is safeguarded. 


This dual approach simplifies audit log management and enhances the visibility of operations within and around the Redshift clusters, making it easier to take a proactive stance on security and compliance.
