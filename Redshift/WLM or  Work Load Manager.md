Enables users to flexibly manage priorities within workloads so that short, fast-running queries won’t get stuck in queues behind long-running queries. 

When you run a query, WLM assigns the query to a queue according to the user’s user group or by matching a query group that is listed in the queue configuration with a query group label that the user sets at runtime.
