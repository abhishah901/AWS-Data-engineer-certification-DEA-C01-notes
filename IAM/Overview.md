AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.

When a principal makes a request in AWS, the AWS enforcement code checks whether the principal is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions). 

You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities or AWS resources. 

Policies are JSON documents in AWS that, when attached to an identity or resource, define their permissions.
