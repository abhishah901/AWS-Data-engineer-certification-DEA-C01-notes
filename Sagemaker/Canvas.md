SageMaker Canvas is a feature of Amazon SageMaker that represents a no-code approach to machine learning. It makes machine learning accessible to users of all technical backgrounds. With a user-friendly interface, it automates data preparation, model selection, training, and deployment. This allows users to create predictive models without needing to write any code. Canvas simplifies the entire process of applying machine learning, from data cleaning to making predictions.

In building a model, SageMaker Canvas offers different types of models, which are the following:

Numeric prediction (regression) model is used to predict numeric data such as the price of houses based on features like square footage.

Categorical prediction (classification) model is mainly used in categorizing data into groups, which also have two categorical prediction model types:

2 category prediction (also known as binary classification in machine learning) is used when you have two categories you want to predict for your data, such as determining whether a customer will churn.

3+ category prediction (multi-class classification) is used to predict three or more categories, such as a customer’s loan status based on past payments.

Time series forecasting is useful for making predictions over a period of time, such as sales predictions for the next quarter.

Image prediction (single-label image classification) model can be used for image labeling.

Text prediction (multi-class text classification) If you have a collection of customer reviews for a particular product and you want to categorize the passages of text to determine whether customers had a positive, negative, or neutral opinion about the product, you can utilize this model to assign a label to each passage of text. This approach can help you analyze the sentiment of the reviews and gain valuable insights about the product’s performance.
